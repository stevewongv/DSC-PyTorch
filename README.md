# DSC-PyTorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of ["Direction-Aware Spatial Context Features for Shadow Detection, CVPR'18"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04142) and detection part of ["Direction-Aware Spatial Context Features for Shadow Detection and Removal, T-PAMI'19"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04635) based on [Xiaowei](https://xw-hu.github.io)'s [DSC (Caffe)](https://github.com/xw-hu/DSC) written by Tianyu Wang.

The Spacial IRNN is implemented by using CUDA 9.0. The backbone is ResNeXt101 pre-trained on ImageNet and the implementation of loss is from [Quanlong Zheng](https://quanlzheng.github.io). 

## Results
We use two GTX 1080Ti to train the DSC on SBU dataset.

### SBU
| Methods | BER | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSC (Caffe) | 5.59 |**0.97** |
| DSC (Our) | **5.43** | 0.96 |

**Pre-trained model is unavailable. You can train your own model.**
<!-- * You can download the pre-trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17VfUOu5xwHHc3M05N0oCjF2FGGirw7gt/view?usp=sharing) and put it into `SBU_model` folder. -->

* You can download the ResNeXt101 model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EDUcaGNiakWO9Xvk9kWgkkcnTYZ6VQoT) and put it in main folder.

## Requirements
* PyTorch == 0.4.1 (1.0.x may not work for training)
